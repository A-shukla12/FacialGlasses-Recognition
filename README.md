# FacialGlasses-Recognition
This project contains the implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier 
which is a supervised machine learning algorithm to recognize faces and if an individual is 
wearing glasses or not on the Olivetti Faces dataset from the scikit-learn library in Python. In addition, we have also used cross validation method to better understand our formed modelâ€™s performance and its various parameters
